# Runtime-only package:
# - unixodbc: shared library required by pyodbc (MSSQL BI connector) at
#   import/connect time. No -dev headers needed, nothing is compiled here.
#
# curl is intentionally NOT installed here: checked apowerb/apowerb-hosting
# (docker-compose, k8s manifests, Helm chart) and nothing execs curl inside
# this container. docker-compose has no healthcheck on the apowerb service
# at all; the Helm/k8s readiness and liveness probes use httpGet, which the
# kubelet calls over the network, not a container exec. If that changes,
# add curl back explicitly.
#
# perl-base ships as an Essential package in the upstream python:3.13-slim
# (Debian trixie) base image itself -- it is not pulled in by anything
# above. It is not used by this application at runtime (pure Python/ASGI
# service), so it is purged here. This removes the perl 5.40.1-6 CVE
# surface (CVE-2026-13221, CVE-2026-12087, both CVSS 9.1, no fix published
# for this Debian release) from the final image entirely.
#
# Consequence for anyone extending this image (FROM apowerb/apowerb):
# `apt-get install` still works afterwards for ordinary packages (dpkg/apt
# themselves don't require perl), but installing a package whose postinst
# or maintainer scripts are written in Perl (e.g. build-essential, which
# pulls in dpkg-dev -> libdpkg-perl) will re-pull perl-base automatically
# to satisfy that dependency -- apt resolves it like any other missing
# dependency, it does not error out. There is no permanently broken state;
# worst case is a slightly bigger derived image, not a failed build.
