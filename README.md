# apowerb

Agentic framework for building and deploying AI agents: flexible orchestration, custom
tool integration, RAG, Text-to-SQL, webhooks and scheduled runs.

This repository is the **open-source core**. Some capabilities named in the product —
billing, usage metering, prospection, identity-provider sign-in, multi-factor
authentication, agent evaluation, supervision, organisation management — ship as separate
commercial bricks and are **absent here**. Where the core holds a hook for one, it is
documented as such. A `404` on those routes means "not in this edition", not "object not
found".

The **administration panel is part of this edition**: users, groups, permissions, MFA
enforcement. Only the management of *organisations* is sold separately — deciding which
tenant a person belongs to governs other people's reach, rather than serving whoever runs
the install.

## Configuration

### Required Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DB_HOST` | PostgreSQL database host |
| `DB_PORT` | Port (default: `5432`) |
| `DB_NAME` | Database name |
| `DB_USER` | Database username |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password |
| `DB_SCHEMA` | Schema (default: `public`) |
| `ENCRYPT_KEY` | Encryption key for secrets and JWT signing |

### Optional Variables

#### Security & JWT

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WORKING_MODE` | `development` | `development` or `production` |
| `ALGORITHM` | `HS256` | JWT signing algorithm |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `120` | JWT token lifetime |

#### Public URLs

Where this installation is reached, and where it sends people. Each one ships
with a `localhost` default, which is right on a laptop and wrong everywhere
else — a value handed to a browser or written into a mail points at the
*reader's* machine, not at the server.

**Set `APP_PUBLIC_URL` and four others follow.**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `APP_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Public URL of the front app. **Password-reset and e-mail-verification links are built from it**, and the settings below are deduced from it |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Public URL of this API, for the callback URLs it hands out to webhooks |
| `ROOT_PATH` | `http://localhost:8000` | Base of the HTTP calls this API makes to **itself**. Usually an internal address, not the public one |

Declaring `APP_PUBLIC_URL` fills these in, their paths being fixed by the
pages that serve them — only the origin varies:

| Deduced | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_REDIRECT_URI` | `<APP_PUBLIC_URL>/integrations/github/callback` |
| `GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_REDIRECT_URI` | `<APP_PUBLIC_URL>/integrations/google/callback` |
| `FRONTEND_URLS` | `<APP_PUBLIC_URL>` |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `<APP_PUBLIC_URL>` |

**Anything you set yourself always wins** — deducing only fills a blank, and
only from a base that is a single absolute URL, scheme included. A base
declared but empty, or holding a comma-separated list, deduces nothing and is
reported by the startup warning below. An installation that configures none of
these behaves exactly as before.

⚠️ `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` deduced from your front URL **widens** what the
browser is allowed to call from, compared with the `localhost` default. That
is the intent — but it is a security setting, so set it yourself if your
policy is narrower than "the front I just declared".

⚠️ `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` are **not** deduced, and not
read either: the front computes its own sign-in callback from the browser's
origin and sends it with the code exchange. Setting them changes nothing.

#### CORS

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000` | The origin whitelist CORS actually uses (comma-separated) |
| `FRONTEND_URLS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Despite the name, **not** read by CORS — only used to derive the Outlook mail OAuth callback |

#### OAuth — User Login

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth (login) |
| `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` | GitHub login callback |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth (login) |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | Google login callback |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` / `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Microsoft OAuth (login) |
| `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` | Microsoft tenant (`common` for multi-tenant) |
| `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` / `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` | LinkedIn OAuth (login) |

#### OAuth — Workspace Integrations

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth app for Google Workspace (Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Docs) |
| `GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google integration secret |
| `GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_REDIRECT_URI` | Google integration callback |
| `MICROSOFT_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth app for Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint) |
| `MICROSOFT_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET` | Microsoft integration secret |
| `MICROSOFT_INTEGRATION_TENANT_ID` | Microsoft integration tenant |
| `MICROSOFT_INTEGRATION_REDIRECT_URI` | Microsoft integration callback |
| `OUTLOOK_MAIL_REDIRECT_URI` | Callback for the Outlook Mail tool connection. Deduced from `APP_PUBLIC_URL` |
| `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth app for GitHub workspace integration |
| `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub integration secret |
| `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_REDIRECT_URI` | GitHub integration callback |

#### Gmail Pub/Sub Webhooks

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GMAIL_PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID` | Google Cloud project ID |
| `GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC` | Pub/Sub topic name (just the name, not the full path) |

#### RAG & Webhooks

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Public URL of this apowerb instance |
| `RAG_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `th2-webhook-default-secret` | HMAC-SHA256 secret for RAG webhooks (change in production!) |
| `RAG_BASE_URL` | — | RAG API base URL (th2llm) |

#### Stripe (billing brick)

`settings` still declares these, and `user` still carries `stripe_customer_id`, but the
billing routes and the credit logic live in the **billing brick**. Setting them changes
nothing in a core-only install.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Stripe publishable key |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook signing secret |

#### S3 Storage (optional)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STORAGE_MODE` | `local` or `s3` |
| `S3_REGION` | AWS region |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` | S3 credentials |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | S3 endpoint URL |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Bucket name |

#### Orchestrator (scheduled runs, optional)

Two backends drive scheduled runs. `ORCHESTRATOR` selects one; the code still defaults to
`mage`, the historical backend, so an instance that wants th2etl must say so explicitly.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ORCHESTRATOR` | `mage` | `mage` or `th2etl` |

With `ORCHESTRATOR=th2etl`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TH2ETL_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8009` | th2etl instance |
| `TH2ETL_API_KEY` | — | Must equal the `API_KEY` of that th2etl instance — its business routes require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` |

With `ORCHESTRATOR=mage`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:6789` | Mage AI scheduler URL |
| `API_KEY` | — | Mage API key |
| `OAUTH_TOKEN` | — | Mage OAuth token |
| `PROJECT_NAME` | `default_repo` | Mage project name |

#### Extensions

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TH2_EXTENSIONS` | — | Comma-separated modules to load as bricks |

Installing a brick and loading it are two different steps: a package present in the
environment but absent from `TH2_EXTENSIONS` behaves exactly like one that was never
installed. Check the loaded set, not the installed set, when a capability seems missing.

<!-- Naming: the variable predates the rename from th2agent to apowerb and is read
     verbatim by the deploy workflow, so it keeps its name. -->

## Running

### Via CLI

```bash
apowerb serve
```

### Via Uvicorn

```bash
uv run uvicorn apowerb.main:app --reload
```

Server starts at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**

`/docs`, `/redoc` and `/openapi.json` are **removed from the served routes by default**:
they hand the full route inventory to an unauthenticated caller, which is enough to
fingerprint a deployment from the outside. Opt in with `PUBLISH_API_SCHEMA=true` for a
browsable Swagger; `WORKING_MODE=production` overrides that flag as a second lock.

The published reference is at [docs.apowerb.com](https://docs.apowerb.com/api-reference).

Routers not to look for here — they arrive with the bricks: billing, usage, prospection,
identity-provider sign-in, MFA, evaluation, supervision, organisation management
(`/api/admin/organizations*`). The rest of `/api/admin` is here.

### Startup Sequence

On application start, apowerb:
1. Creates required directories (`agents_pool/`, `artifacts_store/`, `uploads/`)
2. Runs auto-migrations (`ensure_*` functions) for all database tables
3. Generates agent Python modules from database
4. Starts the webhook renewal background task (every 6 hours)
5. Mounts the Google ADK FastAPI sub-application

---

## API Reference

The full reference — every route, parameter and response shape — is generated from the
code and published at [docs.apowerb.com/api-reference](https://docs.apowerb.com/api-reference).
It is not duplicated here: a hand-maintained route table in this file went stale within
two weeks last time, and a stale reference is worse than none.

Route families in this edition, all under `/api` unless noted:

| Family | What it covers |
|--------|----------------|
| `auth` | Email/password login, refresh, logout, password reset, email verification |
| `users` | User CRUD, `me` |
| `agents` | Agent CRUD, reload, status, template resync, run |
| `adk` | ADK execution: run, streaming (`run_sse`), sessions, titles, traces |
| `tools`, `tools_config` | Tool registry and per-agent tool configuration |
| `skills`, `workflows` | Reusable skills, multi-step flows |
| `superagents` | Templates composing several agents |
| `rag` | Indexing files, URLs, databases, S3; status and progress stream |
| `artifacts` | Files produced by agents, listing, download, execution, library |
| `files` | Upload (including chunked), download, delete |
| `data-lake` | Pin storage read/write/list |
| `hub` | Publish and clone agents |
| `integrations` | OAuth workspace connections (Google, Microsoft, GitHub) |
| `emailing` | Outlook mail OAuth flow, shared mailboxes |
| `webhooks` | Subscription CRUD and inbound push dispatch |
| `notifications` | User notifications and SSE stream |
| `supervision` | Session list for audit, scoped to what the caller may read |
| `scheduler` | Scheduled runs through the configured orchestrator |
| `charts`, `dashboards`, `bi-*` | BI: charts, dashboards, datasets, refresh, stats |
| `share` | Shareable conversation links |
| `api-keys` | Saved provider keys |
| `config`, `health` | Public configuration, liveness |

Absent from this edition, provided by bricks: `billing`, `usage`, `prospection`,
`campaigns`, MFA (`/api/auth/mfa/*`), identity-provider sign-in (`/api/users/{github,google,microsoft,linkedin}`),
evaluation, supervision, and organisation management (`/api/admin/organizations*`). They
answer `404` here. The rest of `/api/admin` — users, groups, permissions — is served here.

### Upgrading: organisation management left the core

Since the release that carries this note, the five `/api/admin/organizations*` routes are
served by a brick rather than by the core. **The mechanism stayed**, deliberately:

- the `admin_organization` and `admin_org_member` tables are still created here, and
  existing rows are left untouched;
- an administrator is still bounded by the organisation he belongs to, so a boundary
  drawn before the upgrade keeps being enforced after it;
- a user's organisation is still reported by `/api/admin/users` and `/api/admin/me`.

What an install without the brick loses is the ability to **create, rename, delete** an
organisation or to move somebody between two. If you never created one, nothing changes:
with no organisation to belong to, an administrator who is not a superadmin administers
only himself — which is what this build already did.

## Integrations

### OAuth Providers

apowerb supports two categories of OAuth:

1. **User Login** — Sign up / log in via OAuth (GitHub, Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn)
2. **Workspace Integrations** — Connect external services as tools for agents

#### Connecting a Workspace Integration

1. User calls `GET /api/integrations/{provider}/{service}/connect` to get the OAuth URL
2. User authorizes the app on the provider's consent screen
3. Provider redirects to `POST /api/integrations/{provider}/callback`
4. apowerb stores the access/refresh tokens encrypted in the `integrations` table
5. Agent tools can now use the integration tokens

#### Supported Services

| Provider | Services | Scopes |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Google** | Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Docs | Service-specific (e.g., `gmail.readonly`, `drive.readonly`) |
| **Microsoft** | Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint | Service-specific (e.g., `Mail.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`) |
| **GitHub** | Repositories, Gists | `repo`, `gist`, `read:user` |

---

## Webhooks

apowerb can automatically trigger agents when events occur in connected services (new email, etc.). Two providers are supported: **Gmail** (via Google Pub/Sub) and **Outlook** (via Microsoft Graph subscriptions).

### How It Works

```
Email arrives → Provider pushes notification → apowerb receives it
     → Fetches new email content → Runs associated agent → Logs result
```

### Webhook Subscription API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/webhooks/subscriptions` | Create subscription |
| GET | `/api/webhooks/subscriptions` | List subscriptions |
| PATCH | `/api/webhooks/subscriptions/{id}` | Update (agent, template, change_type) |
| DELETE | `/api/webhooks/subscriptions/{id}` | Delete and unsubscribe |
| POST | `/api/webhooks/subscriptions/{id}/renew` | Manually renew |
| GET | `/api/webhooks/logs` | View execution logs |

**Create a subscription:**

```json
POST /api/webhooks/subscriptions
{
  "provider": "google_gmail",
  "resource": "INBOX",
  "agent_id": "AGENT_ID",
  "change_type": "created",
  "agent_message_template": "New email from {{ sender }}: {{ subject }}\n\n{{ body }}"
}
```

### Automatic Renewal

- **Gmail watches** expire after 7 days
- **Outlook subscriptions** expire after 3 days
- A background task runs every **6 hours** and renews subscriptions expiring within 12 hours

### Gmail Webhook Setup (Pub/Sub)

#### Architecture

```
Gmail  ──push──▶  Google Pub/Sub  ──HTTP POST──▶  apowerb
                  (topic)                         /api/webhooks/gmail/notifications
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                                  Fetch new emails via Gmail API
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                                  Run associated agent
```

#### Prerequisites

- A **Google Cloud project** with billing enabled
- **Gmail API** and **Cloud Pub/Sub API** enabled
- A **Google OAuth 2.0 application** for workspace integration
- A **publicly accessible URL** for apowerb

#### Step 1 — Enable Google APIs

```bash
gcloud services enable gmail.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

#### Step 2 — Create a Pub/Sub Topic

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics create gmail-notifications \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

#### Step 3 — Grant Gmail Permission to Publish

Gmail uses the service account `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com` to push notifications. Grant it the **Pub/Sub Publisher** role:

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding gmail-notifications \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/pubsub.publisher"
```

> **Note:** In the Google Cloud Console UI, the "Publisher" role may not appear in the dropdown by default — type "publisher" in the search bar to find it, or use the CLI command above.

#### Step 4 — Create a Push Subscription

```bash
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create gmail-notifications-push \
  --topic=gmail-notifications \
  --push-endpoint=https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/webhooks/gmail/notifications \
  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

#### Step 5 — Configure OAuth 2.0

In [Google Cloud Console → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):

1. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (type: Web application)
2. Add authorized redirect URI: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/integrations/google/callback`
3. Add scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`

#### Step 6 — Set Environment Variables

```bash
GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxxx
GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_REDIRECT_URI=https://YOUR_DOMAIN/integrations/google/callback

GMAIL_PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC=gmail-notifications

PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN
```

#### Step 7 — Connect Gmail Account

In the apowerb-ui UI: **Integrations → Connect Google (Gmail)**

#### Step 8 — Create Webhook Subscription

Via UI (Webhook Manager) or API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/webhooks/subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "google_gmail",
    "resource": "INBOX",
    "agent_id": "AGENT_ID",
    "change_type": "created"
  }'
```

### Outlook Webhook Setup

#### Prerequisites

- A registered **Microsoft Azure AD application**
- **Microsoft Graph API** permissions: `Mail.Read`
- A publicly accessible HTTPS URL

#### Setup

1. Configure `MICROSOFT_INTEGRATION_*` environment variables
2. Connect Outlook integration in the UI
3. Create a webhook subscription with `"provider": "microsoft_outlook"`

The Outlook handler uses Microsoft Graph change notifications with `clientState` validation.

### Webhook Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG lets agents answer questions based on documents you provide — PDFs, web pages, database exports, or S3 files.

### How It Works

```
Upload documents → Documents get indexed (via th2llm) → Agent searches them when answering
```

### Indexing Sources

| Source | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Files | `POST /api/rag/index-files` | Upload PDF, CSV, TXT, DOCX, etc. (max 50 MB/file) |
| URL | `POST /api/rag/index-url` | Crawl and index a web page |
| Database (SQL) | `POST /api/rag/index-db` | Index query results using a SQL query |
| Database (NL) | `POST /api/rag/index-db-nl` | Index query results using natural language |
| S3 | `POST /api/rag/index-s3` | Index files from an S3 bucket |

### Tracking Progress

- **Poll**: `GET /api/rag/status/{knowledge_id}`
- **Stream (SSE)**: `GET /api/rag/stream/{agent_id}?session_id=xxx`

### Security

- Path traversal prevention on session/agent IDs
- SSRF protection on URL indexing (blocks localhost, private IPs)
- Session ownership validation
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification on th2llm webhooks

---

## Text-to-SQL

Agents can connect to relational databases and convert natural language questions into SQL queries.

1. Create a database tool config with connection parameters
2. Create an agent with `text_to_sql` tool enabled
3. Ask questions — the agent introspects the schema, generates SQL, executes it, and returns results

---

## SSE Streaming

Three SSE streaming channels are available:

| Channel | Endpoint | Events |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Agent response** | `POST /api/adk/run_sse` | Token-by-token agent output |
| **RAG progress** | `GET /api/rag/stream/{agent_id}` | `connected`, `status`, `complete` |
| **Notifications** | `GET /api/notifications/stream` | Real-time user notifications |

---

## Credits and billing

Not in this edition. The `user` row carries a credit balance and `transactions` /
`credit_purchases` exist in the schema, but the packages, the Stripe checkout and the
crediting logic belong to the **billing brick**. `/api/billing/*` answers `404` here.

The `llm_usage` table is declared here, but **nothing in the core writes to it**: the
metering is the usage brick's job. A core-only install has the table and leaves it empty.

---

## Scheduled runs

Agent runs can be automated on a schedule. The core does not run the cron itself: it
registers the schedule with an external orchestrator, selected by `ORCHESTRATOR`
(`th2etl`, or the historical `mage` which is still the code default).

```json
POST /api/adk/schedule_run
{
  "agent_id": "agent42",
  "user_id": "user@example.com",
  "session_id": "session_scheduled",
  "new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{ "text": "Generate the daily report" }]
  },
  "schedule_interval": "@daily",
  "start_time": "2026-03-10T08:00:00"
}
```

### Schedule Presets

| Preset | Cron |
|--------|------|
| `@hourly` | `0 * * * *` |
| `@daily` | `0 0 * * *` |
| `@weekly` | `0 0 * * 0` |
| `@monthly` | `0 0 1 * *` |
| Custom | e.g., `*/15 * * * *` |

---

## Agent Hub

Agents can be published to a shared Hub and cloned by other users:

- `POST /api/hub/publish` — Publish an agent (copies config, tools, instructions)
- `POST /api/hub/clone` — Clone a Hub agent into your workspace
- `GET /api/hub` — Browse available agents

---

## Database Models

| Table | Description | Key Fields |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `user` | User accounts | email, password, role, credits, stripe_customer_id, OAuth IDs, `mfa_enabled`, `mfa_required`, `sessions_valid_from` |
| `integrations` | Connected OAuth services | user_id, provider, access_token, refresh_token, scopes, meta |
| `webhook_subscriptions` | Active webhook watches | user_id, integration_id, provider, subscription_id, resource, agent_id, status, expiration |
| `webhook_logs` | Webhook execution history | subscription_id, trigger_event, email_subject, agent_response, duration_ms, status |
| `notifications` | User notifications | user_id, title, message, type (webhook/info/warning/error), is_read |
| `transactions` | Credit movements | user_id, type (purchase/usage/refund/bonus), amount, balance_after, stripe IDs |
| `credit_purchases` | Stripe purchase sessions | user_id, stripe_session_id, credits_amount, price_paid, status |
| `llm_usage` | Per-call token accounting | agent_id, owner_id, invocation_id, model, token counts, created_at |
| `business_intelligence` | BI charts, dashboards, datasets | owner, definition, refresh state |
| `shared_conversations` | Shareable conversation links | share_id, session, owner |
| `oauth_states` | Short-lived OAuth state tokens | state, provider, expiry |

Sessions, events and ADK artifacts live in the tables Google ADK owns (`sessions`,
`events`), which supervision reads directly rather than fanning out one HTTP call per
agent.

Some columns here serve bricks rather than the core: `credits`, `stripe_customer_id`,
`mfa_*` and the `transactions` / `credit_purchases` / `llm_usage` tables are declared so a
brick can use them, and stay untouched without one.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `400` | Bad request — check your request body |
| `401` | Unauthorized — missing or invalid token |
| `403` | Forbidden — you don't own this resource |
| `404` | Not found — agent, session, or document doesn't exist |
| `413` | File too large — max 50 MB per file |
| `422` | Unprocessable — e.g., query returned no data |
| `500` | Internal server error |
| `503` | Service temporarily unavailable |
