"""Builds the whole artifact library from S3 keys alone.

The tab used to ask the API once per session, plus once per agent for the
shared scope. Measured on the dev bucket with a real account: 386 sessions
meant ~400 HTTP calls at ~200 ms each — six in flight, so roughly fifteen
seconds before anything appeared, and that floor held even for sessions
holding nothing.

Every field the screen shows is already in the key:

    artifacts/{agent}/{session}/{segment}/{filename}/{version}/{leaf}
    uploads/{agent}/{filename}                                (legacy)

Agent, session, input-or-output, name and version all come from the path;
the language comes from the extension; the date and size come from the
listing response itself. So the library is built without downloading a
single object body.

**Two listings in total**, not two per agent. Listing each agent's prefix
separately cost 24 calls for an account owning 12 agents — 1 896 ms,
sequentially, for seven artifacts. Sweeping both roots costs 151 ms and
238 ms whatever the number of agents, and the ownership filter runs in
memory. That trade holds while the bucket stays small (470 objects here);
if it ever grows past the point where a full sweep is slower than N
targeted listings, this is the decision to revisit.
