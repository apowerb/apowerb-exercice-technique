    The function is best-effort: it only flags exact duplicates of the same
    key. Unknown keys, malformed lines, comments and ``export FOO=bar``
    prefixes are tolerated. It never raises and never blocks boot.

    Edge cases the helper *does not* try to solve (intentional):

    - **Quoted keys** (``"FOO"=bar``). Some ``.env`` parsers accept them,
      others reject them; we strip surrounding quotes from the key so a
      mix of quoted and unquoted forms of the same name still flags as a
      duplicate. Quoted *values* (``FOO="bar=baz"``) are unaffected — only
      the key side is normalised.
    - **Multi-line values** (``FOO="line1\\nline2"``). pydantic-settings
      handles those, but the parser here treats every newline as a line
      boundary. False negatives are possible if a duplicate of the
      *outer* key appears between the lines of a multi-line value, which
      is so unusual we accept it and document it here.
    - **CRLF line endings**. ``.strip()`` already handles ``\\r``; the
      double-strip in the body (raw and key) protects against trailing
      ``\\r`` even if the outer one is removed.
