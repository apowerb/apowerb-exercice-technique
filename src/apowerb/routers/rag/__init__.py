"""RAG router package — aggregates endpoint sub-modules into a single APIRouter.

Consumers (``main.py`` and tests) import ``router`` from this package.  The
top-level symbols re-exported here (``append_source``, ``rag_manager``,
``_sync_index_db``, ``_sync_index_db_nl``) preserve the pre-split public
patching surface: ``unittest.mock.patch("apowerb.routers.rag.<name>", ...)``
still targets the same attribute, and every endpoint resolves the name via
``apowerb.routers.rag`` so the patch takes effect.
