"""Self-healing schema migration for the ``webhook_logs`` queue.

PR #120 widened the ``webhook_logs`` model with the queue/backlog
columns (``resource_id``, ``payload_json``, ``attempts``,
``next_attempt_at``, ``started_at``, ``completed_at``) and two new
indexes. The runtime relies on
``Base.metadata.create_all(checkfirst=True)`` which only creates
*missing tables* — it never alters an existing one.

On that deployment this meant the table stayed on the old shape after the
PR #120 deploy and every Microsoft Graph notification raised
``UndefinedColumnError``. The fix was a one-shot migration script,
but the same trap is waiting on every other environment that
predates PR #120 (OVH_DEV, DAVE_OVH, anyone redeploying from a stale
DB).

This module ports that migration into the worker's startup path so
the schema heals itself the first time the worker boots in a fresh
environment — and stays a no-op on every subsequent boot. The
operations are guarded by ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` and
``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`` so concurrent boots cannot collide.

We deliberately keep the migration narrow:
- only DDL on the table the worker owns (``webhook_logs``)
- only additive changes (no drop / rename)
- failures are logged but never block the worker — the operator can
  still rerun the standalone script if needed.
