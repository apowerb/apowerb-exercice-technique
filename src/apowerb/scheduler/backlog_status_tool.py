"""Agent-bound ``get_webhook_backlog_status`` tool factory.

Lets the agent see what's still queued behind the row it is currently
processing — pending count, top of the FIFO, recent throughput. Used
by webhook-driven agents (client overlays) to mention the
backlog state in their final response so the operator knows whether
to wait for more output or start triaging manually.

The tool is bound to a specific ``agent_id`` at build time (via
``to_agent`` → ``bind_get_backlog_status``) so the agent cannot peek
into another agent's queue. The placeholder in
``tools_store/portfolio/basic.py`` returns an error when called
without the binding so a misconfiguration surfaces loudly instead of
silently leaking other agents' rows.
