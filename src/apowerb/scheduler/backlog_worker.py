"""Backlog worker — drains the webhook_logs queue.

Sits behind every webhook ingress so that the LLM run is decoupled from
the provider notification. One in-process asyncio task per backend
instance picks rows in FIFO order, runs the agent for the row, and
records the outcome. ``RateLimitError`` is treated as recoverable:
the row is requeued with ``next_attempt_at = now + retry_delay``
(extracted from the provider payload when available) so the quota
window has time to roll over.

Why a queue instead of FastAPI BackgroundTasks:
- Microsoft Graph re-delivers notifications when our endpoint returns
  late or 5xx. Without a queue, every retry spawned a fresh agent run
  and the rate-limited Gemini quota was hit again on each retry. With
  the queue, the row sits as ``pending`` and the retry just bumps
  ``attempts``.
- Multiple notifications arriving in the same minute would each spawn a
  parallel agent run and saturate the Gemini per-minute input-token
  quota. The queue serialises agent execution to one row at a time.
