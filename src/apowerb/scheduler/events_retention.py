"""Background task that purges old ADK session events.

ADK's ``DatabaseSessionService`` has NO retention policy: the ``events``
table (one row per agent turn, ``event_data`` = the full model_dump of
the event) grows without bound. Left alone it silently eats the shared
``defaultdb`` instance. This loop deletes events older than
``ADK_EVENTS_RETENTION_DAYS`` (default 90) once a day.

Scope: ``events`` only — the large jsonb rows. Sessions and state tables
are left intact (a purged session keeps its shell, just loses old turn
detail). The ADK events table lives in the application schema
(``settings.db_schema``) because the session engine pins ``search_path``
there (see ``main.py``); the DELETE is schema-qualified accordingly.

The pass is defensive: any failure is logged and swallowed so the
background task never crashes the app.
