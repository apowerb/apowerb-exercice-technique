"""Pure Business-Analyst investigation + interpretation loop.

This is the orchestration the text-to-SQL layer was missing: instead of one
question -> one query, an *investigation* runs several chained queries, then a
single interpretation pass turns the gathered evidence into a narrative,
findings, recommendations and an optional chart spec.

It stays PURE on purpose (no ADK, no DB driver, no LLM client, no settings):
the three moving parts are injected as callables so the whole loop is unit
-testable with fakes. The live wiring (Mistral-Large planner/interpreter +
psycopg2 executor) lives in tools_store/portfolio/text_to_sql.py.

    plan_next(question, schema_info, steps) -> dict
        Decides the next move. Returns either {"done": True} to stop, or
        {"sub_question": str, "sql": str} for the next query to run. It sees
        every prior InvestigationStep so it can build on earlier results.

    execute(sql) -> list[dict]
        Runs a validated SELECT and returns rows. May raise; the loop catches.

    interpret(question, steps) -> dict
        Turns the gathered steps into
        {"narrative", "findings", "recommendations", "chart"}.

Safety is non-negotiable and independent of the model: every SQL string is run
through validate_sql_safety before execution, so a hallucinated DROP/DELETE is
recorded as a failed step and NEVER executed.
