"""A placeholder is not a configuration, however it reads in the file.

Production carried `GOOGLE_WEBHOOK_AUDIENCE="tbd"` -- the value this codebase
uses to mean "not set yet", quoted so a grep reports the key as present. The
guard only tested emptiness, so it passed, and Gmail Pub/Sub push notifications
were verified against a value that means nothing.

Same shape as the RAG webhook secret, which already fails closed. This pins the
audience to the same rule.
