"""One URL declared, four deduced -- instead of five chances to forget one.

Five public URLs each shipped its own localhost default, so an operator had
five separate opportunities to leave one behind, and no way to notice: a
default is indistinguishable from a choice once the settings object is built.

Four of them are not independent facts. A callback path is fixed by the page
that serves it; only the origin varies. They are deduced from
`APP_PUBLIC_URL`.

Explicit always wins: deducing fills a blank, and only from a base that is a
single absolute URL. An installation that configures nothing stays exactly as
it was.

The guarded list holds only settings something reads. `github_redirect_uri`
and `google_redirect_uri` are absent although their names fit -- nothing
consults them, the front computing its own callback and sending it with the
code exchange.
