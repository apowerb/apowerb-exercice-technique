"""Regression tests for the duplicate-notification handling in
``handle_outlook_notification``.

Live regression 2026-05-07 15:34 UTC: every Microsoft Graph
re-delivery for the same ``(subscription_id, resource_id)`` surfaced
as a 500 instead of a 202. The unique-index INSERT correctly raised
``IntegrityError`` — the existing ``except`` caught the commit, but
the next line read ``subscription.id`` from the now-expired ORM
instance, which triggered a lazy-load → implicit flush → the
still-pending ``log`` got re-attempted against the index → second
IntegrityError, this one outside the ``try`` → 500.

Two fixes covered here:
  - ORM attribute values are captured into plain locals BEFORE the
    INSERT.
  - The pending ``log`` is ``expunge``d in the duplicate branch so a
    subsequent autoflush does not re-trigger the INSERT.

    Microsoft Graph notification surfaced as a 500 on
    ``POST /api/webhooks/outlook/notifications``. Root cause: after
    ``await db.commit()``, the ``WebhookLog`` instance is expired
    (SQLAlchemy default ``expire_on_commit=True``). The logger call
    that follows reads ``log.id``, which fires a lazy-load SELECT
    outside the greenlet context → ``MissingGreenlet`` exception.

    Fix: call ``await db.flush()`` BEFORE ``await db.commit()`` so the
    primary key is populated via RETURNING while the greenlet is
    still active, then capture ``log_id = log.id`` into a local
    before the commit expires the instance.

    Microsoft Graph retried the notification 1-2s later and the
    second delivery hit the duplicate branch (no commit on the
    expired instance), so no webhook was lost in the end — but
    every fresh AR produced a 500 on the first delivery.
