"""Who may read another account's sessions.

Supervision used `is_admin`, so every administrator saw every agent on the
platform — that is how a colleague, an admin for operational reasons, read
someone else's sessions. The core cannot decide this on its own:
"superadmin" is a row in a table owned by a commercial brick, and the core
never names one. It asks, and a missing brick means no.
