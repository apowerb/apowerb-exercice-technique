"""Anti-regression: webhook ADK session must be one-per-AR.

Live incident 2026-05-19: every Outlook webhook event reused the same
ADK session keyed on ``sub_db_id`` (``session_id="webhook_1"`` for the
SCEI subscription). After a few days the session had accumulated
3656+ events and the next agent run crashed with
``litellm.ContextWindowExceededError`` once Gemini's 1M-token window
was breached.

The fix pins ``session_id`` to ``log_id`` so each webhook event gets
its own conversation — bounded history, no cross-AR pollution.

This test reads the source instead of mocking the full webhook
pipeline (DB session, Outlook fetch, agent run, SSE notify) because
the property we care about is a small invariant on one line of code,
and a source-level pin is both cheaper and harder to silently
regress.
